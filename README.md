Utilizing Patient Data for Accurate Prediction of Postoperative Complications


Tools Used:
1) Pandas, Matplotlib and Numpy for data processing and analysis
2) Scikit-learn for machine learning model development and evaluation

Developed a predictive model that utilizes patient demographic information and medical history to accurately identify patients who are at risk of developing postoperative complications. Conducted feature selection to identify the most important predictors of surgical complications.
